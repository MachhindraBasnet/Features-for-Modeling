    "The iQueue for Operating Rooms is a software product to free up capacity in operating roomsand create a much more transparent and surgeon-centric process for measuring OperatingRoom (OR) utilization.\n",
    "\n",
    "A typical hospital will have multiple ORs, e.g. 10 rooms and they are staffed to carry out surgical procedures Monday to Friday. OR management has utilized a system called Block Scheduling to arrange and coordinate their surgeons to schedule their surgeries smoothly. The idea is that a room is typically reserved for a certain surgeon, or a group of them on a certain day-of-week.\n",
    "E.g. Dr. Johnson gets Room 1 on every Monday, the Thoracic group gets Room 2 on everyWednesday etc. It sometimes can be a bit more nuanced, e.g. the frequency could be bi-weekly or others, and sometimes people may give half day blocks instead of full day blocks depending on the typical case length and volume. Also, many hospitals may assign some open time in some rooms on some days, e.g. every Monday and Wednesday Room 5 is open and it follows FCFS. The benefit of the Block Scheduling system is that it provides some certainty for surgeons and other people involved to carry out a surgical case successfully. The problem with it is that sometimes surgeons cannot fill their blocks well with the cases, e.g. they go on vacations or attend conferences or simply have a slower season etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "One of the modules within the iQueue for OR is called Exchange, which is a marketplace for ORtime. Basically if Dr. Johnson is going to a conference in 5 weeks and knows that he will not need to utilize that Monday block then he can release the time and other people can have the visibility of that released time and may request it in order to utilize the OR resource. In the\n",
    "hospital setting, surgeons, or their schedulers will initiate such requests or releases, and then the OR schedulers will review such activities and make sure they are legit and respond and/or update their internal system.\n",

    "Assignment\n",
    "You work at iQueue for Operating Rooms as a Data Analyst. Recently a new customer just wentlive with our software. They have adopted the Exchange module and their executive sponsorsfor our product wants to know how the implementation has been.\n",
    "\n",
    "The customer success team has a few questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "●How many minutes of requests, transfers and releases have been completed? The marketplace is successful if there's a good amount of activities from both sides.\n",
    "\n",
    "●What is the denial rate and response time?  The marketplace is easy to use iftransactions are both quick and easy.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to get a more complete picture, the customer success team has tasked you to help answer \n",
    "\n",
    "​how effective the marketplace is ​by answering these questions along with anyadditional findings you can provide. \n",
    "\n",
    "So given the attached data for the Exchange transactionhistory, your job here is to create a narrative for the customer success team and the executivesponsors. \n",
    "\n",
    "You need to think through how you want to define effectiveness, e.g. maybe it’s onlyeffective if the time released are requested etc.. \n",
    "\n",
    "Also think through the secondary metrics, e.g.\n",
    "what can the team track and encourage in order to increase the effectiveness etc.?\n",
    "\n",
    "The exercise may include the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "●Prepare a short executive summary for your findings and potential actions for the executive sponsors at hospitals.\n",
    "\n",
    "●Prepare a dashboard that tracks certain metrics that can tell your narrative on how effective the marketplace is.\n",
    "\n",
    "●Prepare a short note suggesting to the internal team on what additional data needs to be pulled and investigated, if any\n",
